a) What are the problems of this clustering algorithm?

- Conditionning of the final condition that can be very long.
- It requires heavily computational ressources.
- The resultats depends a lot of the initialization.
- We don't perceive color as far away that the norm of the RGB vectors could be.
- Two colors far apart in RGB can look similar to the eye, and vice versa.


b) How can I improve the results?
- To reduce the problem of two RGB vector face our perception, we can use the 'LAB' color space before clustreing to reduce the gap. (It's not obvious)
- Perhap's reduce the noise of colors by bluring the image. (It seems to make better edge but decrease the quality of the image of course)
- reduce the dimension to accelerate the computational. 
- We can also improve the initialization by running K-Means several times (e.g., 5 times) and keeping the result with the largest inter-cluster distance (done with n_init but hard to compare)
